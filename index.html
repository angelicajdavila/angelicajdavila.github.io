		<h2> Who dat? </h2>
	
		<p>Angelica is the child of immigrants, which makes her a speaker of two languages, and master of none. Similar to her bilingual abilities, she also likes to do a variety of things. Having lost Fanta’s “4th Fantana Search” back in 2010, Angelica has chosen to spend her time pursuing comedy and writing. It is, however, said that she can often be heard whispering “Want a Fanta, don’t you wanta” during her sleep. When Angelica isn’t busy writing or telling jokes, she works at her big, girl job as an autism and developmental delays consultant for parents, teachers, and other professionals because her family always told her to have a back up career.</p>
